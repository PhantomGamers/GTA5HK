Steps to use Hotkeys (these are not mods and should not get you banned)

1. Extract GTA5HK.exe and GTA5HK.ini to the same folder.
2. Run GTA5HK.exe
3. Play

OR

1. Download Autohotkey
2. Put GTA5HK.ahk and GTA5HK.ini in autohotkey folder
3. double click GTA5HK.ahk to run (make a shortcut for it on your desktop)
4. Play

Note: Make sure Scroll Lock is disabled whilst you are not a CEO (in heists, retired) and enabled when you become a CEO.

How to read or modify the controls:
Open the .ini file [the controls] by right clicking GTA5HK.ini and clicking edit.
If you wish to unbind any of the functions, simply insert a ; in front of the offending key's line to comment it out.

How to configure auto relaunch:
If you have the Steam version, open the ini file and change gameVersion to 0 instead of 1
If you have the Social Club version of the game and run it through Steam, edit the game version to 1 and change game id to the non steam game id.
Otherwise set gameVersion to anything other than 0 or 1 and it won't auto relaunch. 2 works fine.
